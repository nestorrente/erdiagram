# ERDiagram: Entity-Relationship diagram code generator

## Online demo

You can try _ERDiagram_ online using the [ERDiagram playground](http://erdiagram.nestorrente.com/) application.
There you will find some code examples that are very useful for learning the _ERDiagram_ language.

## Supported output formats

    * MySQL
    * Oracle DB
    * SQL Server

    * Java POJO (no JPA support so far)
    * TypeScript

## Documentation

* **[ERDiagram language](docs/ERDiagram_language.md)**: how to define entities and relationships.
    * **[Database model](docs/Database_model.md)**: how entities and relationships are modelled as tables and columns.
    * **[Class model](docs/Class_model.md)**: how entities and relationships are modelled as OOP classes.

## Contributing

This is a side project I'm working on during my spare time, so I'd be very happy if you want to contribute :grinning: bug
report, suggestions, pull requests or any other kind of feedback are more than welcome.

If you want to create a PR, just be sure you're working on the _develop_ branch and go ahead :slightly_smiling_face:

### Wish list

This is a small list of features/tools that I'll be very happy to have:

* More database engines support (i.e. SQLite, PostgreSQL).
* More OOP languages support (i.e. C#).
* Syntax highlight for some text editors or IDEs (i.e. Sublime Text, Atom, IntelliJ IDEA, VS Code...).
* XSD / JSON Schema generation.
* Liquibase files generation.
* Any other cool stuff :stuck_out_tongue:
