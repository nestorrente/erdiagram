# ERDiagram language

This language allows to define entities and relationships in a concise way. In the following sections, you will learn
how to define an entity, its properties and its relationships.

## Defining an entity

This is the way you can define an `User` entity with `name`, `lastName` and `active` properties:

```erdiagram
User
  name text(50)
  lastName text(50)
  active bool
```

As you can see, the properties of an entity must be indented (no matter how many tabs or spaces you use). Properties are
defined by writing its name followed by its type, which can include an optional length, similar to SQL.

### Supported property types

* `bool`: a boolean value, like _true_ and _false_.
* `short`, `int` and `long`: integer numeric values, like _42_, _73_ or _2038_.
* `decimal`: real numeric values, like _3.14_.
* `text`: string values, like _hello world_ or _don't be evil_.
* `date`: a date without time, like _01/01/1970_.
* `time`: a time representation, like _00:00:00_.
* `datetime`: a date and time representation, like _01/01/1970 at 00:00:00_.
* `blob`: a binary object, a.k.a. a byte array.
* `identifier`: a special type that represents the identifier of the entity.

### Property modifiers

Also, it's possible to add some _modifier characters_ after a property's name. Supported modifiers are:

* Optional modifier (`?`): indicates that the property may or may not have a value.
* Unique modifier (`!`): indicates that each possible value of the property must be used by at most one of the instances
  of the entity.
* Auto-incremental modifier (`+`): indicates the property is auto-incremental, so sequential values will be assigned
  every time an instance of the entity is created.

Here you can see an example of defining an optional unique property:

```erdiagram
Task
  description text(100)
  priorityOrder?! int
  done bool
```

### Entity identifier property

Notice that we haven't defined an identifier property for the entities of the previous examples. When we don't define an
identifier for an entity, _ERDiagram_ will generate one for us. By default, that property will be named `id` both in
[Database Model](Database_model.md) and [Class Model](Class_model.md), but it's possible to use different
_[naming strategies (TODO add link)](#)_. Another possibility is to explicitly declare the identifier property of the
entity:

```erdiagram
User
  theUserId identifier
  name text(50)
  lastName text(50)
  active bool
```

An entity **cannot** have more that one `identifier` property, and this property doesn't accept any
[modifier](#property-modifiers). Also, it doesn't matter if that property is defined at the beginning of the entity or
in another position; it will always be considered the first property of the entity.

## Relationships

Each relationship is defined by its _direction_ and _cardinality_. It's _direction_ indicates how data can be accessed,
while it's _cardinality_ indicates how many elements constitute the relationship. You can know more about
_cardinalities_ [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinality_(data_modeling)).

### Directions

_ERDiagram_ supports 3 different direction values:

* _left to right_ (`->`): indicates that the _right_ entity of the relationship is accessible from the _left_ entity.
* _right to left_ (`<-`): indicates that the _left_ entity of the relationship is accessible from the _right_ entity.
* _bidirectional_ (`<->`): indicates that both entities are accessible from the other.

### Aliases

It's possible to name the members of a relationship using _aliases_. Imagine you are modelling a `Travel` entity which
has two `originCity` and `destinyCity` attributes, both referencing the `City` entity. You could write `Travel -> City`
in order to model one relationship from `Travel` to `City`, but how can you model both relationships at the same time?

The way that _ERDiagram_ solves this is by using _aliases_:

```erdiagram
Travel *-> City originCity
Travel *-> City destinyCity
```

By doing this, you're naming the right member of your relationship. You can also name both sides of the relationship,
just like this:

```erdiagram
Employee subordinates *<-> Employee boss
```

When you don't specify any _alias_, the name of the entity is used as the name of the member.

### Cardinalities

This is how you can define the different types of relationships (examples are written using bidirectional
relationships):

* _one-to-one_: `A 1<->1 B` or simply `A <-> B`.
* _one-to-many_: `A 1<->* B` or simply `A <->* B`.
* _many-to-one_: `A *<->1 B` or simply `A *<-> B`.
* _many-to-many_: `A *<->* B`.

As you can see, you can omit the character `1`, as that's the default cardinality.

In addition to `1` and `*` characters, it's also possible to use the question mark character (`?`)
in order to indicate a `0..1` cardinality. For example, imagine you are modelling a tree structure, where each node has
a relationship to its parent. As root nodes don't have a parent, the relationship should be a _many-to-zero-or-one_,
which can be written this way:

```erdiagram
TreeNode child *<->? TreeNode parent
```

### Relationship's name

It's also possible to define a name for the relationship. This is done by writing it between brackets after the
relationship definition:

```erdiagram
User *<->* User (Friendship)
```

This is specially useful in _many-to-many_ relationships, in order to define the name of the _intermediate table_ of the
[Database Model](Database_model.md).

### Relationship examples

#### Example 1

```erdiagram
Employee *<-> Company
```

The cardinality of this relationship indicates that each employee belongs to one company, and each company has many
employees.

On the other side, its direction indicates that the employee's company can be accessed from the Employee instance, and
the company's employees can be accessed from the Company instance.

#### Example 2

```erdiagram
Employee *->? Employee boss
```

The cardinality of this relationship indicates that each employee may have a boss or not, and it can have many
subordinates.

On the other side, its direction indicates that employee's boss can be accessed from the Employee instance, but it's not
possible to get its subordinates.

#### Example 3

```erdiagram
Employee *<-* Project (EmployeesWorkingOnProjects)
```

The cardinality of this relationship indicates that each employee can work on many projects, and each project can have
many employees working on it.

On the other side, its direction indicates that it's possible to get the employees that are working on a project, but
it's not possible to access to an employee's projects.

Finally, the relationship's name is _EmployeesWorkingOnProjects_, which may be used as a name for the intermediate
_relationship table_ used in relational databases.

## Comments

Even when [Uncle Bob](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_C._Martin) doesn't like them, every language needs comments,
so _ERDiagram_ couldn't be less :stuck_out_tongue:

Comments begin with a _hash_ character (`#`) followed by any other ones. Only line comments are supported so far.

Here you can see some example comments:

```erdiagram
TreeNode
  description text(100)
  deleted bool # we use logical erase

# The root node doesn't have a parent, that's why
# the "parent" member of the relationship is optional.
TreeNode child *<->? TreeNode parent
```
